# data-sourcing-challenge

In this challenge, us students were tasked with accessing contents within APIs
- NYT API
*AND*
- TMDB API

To start we were tasked with creating a dataframe that held information from the
NYT API, in this case we were accessing movies from 2013-2023. From the dataframe,
we accessed the title column only, and created a list of titles that we would utilize 
when creating a dataframe for the TMDB movie data.

To wrap up the assignment, we merged the two dataframes, and cleaned it up to make it appear
neater. And lastly, we saved all of the dataframe contents into a csv file.

Throughout this challenge, we used different commands to complete certain steps.
- json_normalize
- json.dumps
- requests.get
